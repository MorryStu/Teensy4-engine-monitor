Engine monitor that displays oil,temp,boost,....whatever....it just reads sensors and displays them
Sensors/inputs are mapped to respective human values
The display shows each sensor as a ring meter ( 300* so not a full circle ) with colour gradient. Like an automotive gauge display
example---and these are loose and may not match the actual code
Engine temp ring goes from Blue-green-Red 0-120*C
Oil Pressure goes red-yellow-green 0-75 PSI
Boost goes from red-green 0-15PSI
EGT goes from green to red 200-800*c
